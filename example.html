    <p class="Bonnymed">Who ever loved that loved not at first sight? The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.</p> 
    <p class="Bonnymin">In the still of the night, as the moon rose high in the sky, a young prince stood atop the battlements of his castle. He gazed out at the rolling hills and forests beyond, lost in thought. The weight of his responsibility as the future king weighed heavily on his mind, and he wondered if he was truly up to the task. But as he stood there, he was reminded of a prophecy that had been passed down through the generations of his family. It spoke of a great hero who would rise up and save the kingdom from darkness, and bring peace and prosperity to the land. The prince couldn't help but wonder if he was that hero. Despite his doubts and fears, he knew deep down that he had to try. He vowed to become the strongest and wisest ruler that his kingdom had ever known, and to do all that he could to fulfill the prophecy and bring hope to his people. And so he set out on his journey, facing many trials and tribulations along the way. But through it all, he never lost sight of his goal, and slowly but surely he grew in strength and wisdom. In the end, he became the hero that the prophecy had spoken of, and brought peace and prosperity to his kingdom, earning the love and respect of his people. And as he looked back on his journey, he knew that he had found his true purpose in life, and that he would always be remembered as a great and noble king.
