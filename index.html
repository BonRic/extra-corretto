<h1>Font Share</h1>
<body>
     <p class="indextext1">Fontshare is a free fonts service launched by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). 
        It’s a growing collection of professional grade fonts that are 100% free for personal and commercial use. 
        Our mission is to make high-quality and technically sound fonts accessible to everyone.</p>

        <p class="indextext">For a number of years, ITF has offered students, design institutions and other
             not-for-profit organisations all of its commercial fonts for free. Between 2014-2016, it released several
              open-source fonts, including the incredibly popular Poppins (which is used on millions of websites across 
              the globe), Khand, Rajdhani, Hind and Teko, to name just a few. It has also invested a large proportion 
              of its resources in developing fonts for languages that are rare or on the brink of extinction, even though 
              this is not commercially profitable. </p>
        
        <p class="indextext3">The launch of Fontshare is an extension of this ideology, with an aim to go even further
             and help brands and individuals who do not have the budget but still want access to beautiful typography. 
             Every fourth Latin font-family that ITF designs will be released through Fontshare and offered for free.</p>
        
        <p class="indextext4">Apart from ITF’s own fonts, Fontshare also distributes free fonts from the other publishers.
             We identify-top notch open-source fonts, review their quality, fix any design or technical bugs and publish 
             their latest versions on Fontshare. We ensure that these fonts are of the same quality as ITF’s own free 
             fonts on offer.</p>
        
        <p class="indextext5">Unlike playing russian roulette with many of the widely available free fonts online,
             you can access all Fontshare fonts: it's all free fonts of the highest standard.</p>
